# DSA Daily Note — 2026-02-25

**File reviewed:** `OOPS/PolynomialUse.java`

This `PolynomialUse.java` file?
It showcases a classic DSA, bhai.
We're talking polynomial operations here.

Likely, coefficients live in an array.
`evaluate` method runs in O(N) time.
The commented code shows `add`, `multiply` too.

Yaar, thorough testing is visible.
This is how you build reliable code.
